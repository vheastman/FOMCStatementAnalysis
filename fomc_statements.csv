 For immediate releaseChairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided toincrease slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. The action is expected to be associatedwith a small increase in short-term money market interest rates.
The decision was taken to move toward a less accommodative stance in monetary policy in order tosustain and enhance the economic expansion.Chairman Greenspan decided to announce this action immediately so as to avoid anymisunderstanding of the Committee's purposes, given the fact that this is the first firming of reservemarket conditions by the Committee since early 1989.Home | Press releases

13,19990518,"Release Date: May 18, 1999For immediate releaseThe Federal Reserve released the following 
statement after today's Federal Open MarketCommittee meeting:
While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance of monetary policy, the
Committee was concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances thatcould undermine the favorable performance of the economy and therefore adopted adirective that is tilted toward
 the possibility of a firming in the stance of monetary policy.
Trend increases in costs and core prices 
have generally remained quite subdued. Butdomestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improvedsince the easing of monetary policy last fall. Against the background of already-tightdomestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, theCommittee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that mightindicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation.1999 Monetary policyHome

For immediate releaseThe Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the federal funds rate
25 basis points to 5 percent. Last fall the Committee reduced interest rates to counter asignificant seizing-up of financial markets in the United States. Since then much of the
financial strain has eased, foreign economies have firmed, and economic activity in theUnited States has moved forward at a brisk p
ace. Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment
is judged no longer necessary.
Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivitygrowth has contained inflationary pressures.Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy goingforward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection aboutnear-term policy action. The Committee, nonethel

For immediate releaseThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to leave its target for the federal funds
rate unchanged.Strengthening productivity growth has been fostering favorable trends in unit costs andprices, and much recent information suggests that these trends have been sustained.Nonetheless, the growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply, as evidenced by
a decreasing pool of available workers willing to take jobs. In these circumstances, theFederal Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to thepotential for costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that couldcontribute to inflation pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy.
Against this background, the Committee adopted a directive that was biased toward apossible firming of policy going forward. Committee members emphasi
zed that such adirective did not signify a commitment to near-term action. The Committee will need to
evaluate additional information on the balance of aggregate supply and demand andconditions in financial markets.1999 Monetary policyHome

Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment haveweakened appreciably. In response, manufacturing production has been cut back sharply,

In a related action, the Board of Governorsapproved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 3-1/2 percent.A significant reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced. Consumption andhousing expenditures have held up reasonably well, though activity in these areas hasflattened recently. Investment in capital equi

uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending goingforward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects

With pressures on labor and product markets 
easing, inflation is expected to remaincontained. Although measured productivity growth stalled in the first quarter, the impressive
underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact,
supporting longer-term prospects.

expansion appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects ofgeopolitical uncertainties. The Committee believes that as those uncertainties lift, as mostanalysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing

the current circumstances, heightened surv

For immediate releaseThe Federal Open Market Committee decided to keep its target for the federal funds rate
unchanged at 1-1/4 percent.Recent readings on production and employment, though mostly reflecting decisions madebefore the conclusion of hostilities, have proven disappointing. However, the ebbing of
geopolitical tensions has rolled back oil prices, bolstered consumer confidence, andstrengthened debt and equity markets. These developments, along with the accommodativestance of monetary policy and ongoing growth in productivity, should foster an improving
economic climate over time.Although the timing and extent of that improvement remain uncertain, the Committeeperceives that over the next few quarters the upside and downside risks to the attainment ofsustainable growth are roughly equal. In contrast, over the same period, the probability of anunwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation

For immediate releaseThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds
rate by 25 basis points to 3-3/4 percent.Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll ofHurricane Katrina. The widespread devastation in the Gulf region, the associated dislocationof economic activity, and the boost to ener
gy prices imply that spending, production, andemployment will be set back in the near term. In addition to elevating premiums for someenergy products, the disruption to the producti
on and refining infrastructure may add toenergy price volatility.
While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic
performance, it is the Committee's view that
 they do not pose a more persistent threat.Rather, monetary policy accommodation, c
oupled with robust underlying growth inproductivity, is providing ongoing support to ec
onomic activity. Higher energy and other
costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by
25 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.The slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected
temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter butappears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and
other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity
gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remaincontained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices ofenergy and other commodities, have the pot
ential to add to inflation pressures.The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to theattainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by
25 basis points to 5 percent.Economic growth has been quite strong so far this year. The Committee sees growth as likely to
moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market andthe lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.
As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and ot
her commodities appears to have had only a modesteffect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains 
have helped to hold the growth of unit laborcosts in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource
utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the
potential to add to inflation pressures.The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risksbut emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on theevolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.

consumer expenditures. Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened inrecent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospectsfor U.S. exports. Moreover, the intensification of

For immediate release

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds
rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.
 The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely
to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.
Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has
weakened further.
 Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline
steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending.
 Furthermore, global demand appears
to be slowing significantly.
 Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting

government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit

conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight.
 The Committee anticipates that a
gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that

outlook are significant.
In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the
prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation pressures will

remain subdued in coming quarters.
 Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could
persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer

term.The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable
economic growth and to preserve price stability.
 The focus of the Committee's policy is to support
the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations

and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high

level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-
backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to

expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions

warrant. The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving
circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving

conditions in private credit markets.
 The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-
Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small

businesses. The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the
Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess

whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit

markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.

Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Dennis P.

Lockhart; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the
economy continues to contract.
  Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and tight credit
conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.
  Weaker sales prospects and
difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment.
 U.S. exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen into recession.
 Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to

stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will

contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth.
In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation will
remain subdued.
  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time
below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.
In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic
recovery and to preserve price stability.
  The Committee will maintain the target range for the
federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant

exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.
  To provide greater
support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee decided today to increase the size

of the Federal Reserve™s balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of

agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $1.25

trillion this year, and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion to a

total of up to $200 billion.
  Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the
Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next

six months.
  The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to
facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range

of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets.

Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses,

lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit

have led businesses to cut back on inventories, fixed investment, and staffing. Although the

economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing

of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time. Nonetheless,

Swiss National Bank are announcing the reestablishment of temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap

facilities. These facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in U.S. dollar funding
markets and to prevent the spread of strains to other markets and financial centers.
 The Bank of
Japan will be considering similar measures soon.
 Central banks will continue to work together
closely as needed to address pressures in funding markets.
Federal Reserve Actions
The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements

(swap lines) with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB),

and the Swiss National Bank.
 The arrangements with the Bank of England, the ECB, and the Swiss
National Bank will provide these central banks with the capacity to conduct tenders of U.S. dollars

in their local markets at fixed rates for full allotment, similar to arrangements that had been in

place previously.
 The arrangement with the Bank of Canada would support drawings of up to $30
billion, as was the case previously.
These swap arrangements have been authorized through January 2011.
 Further details on these
arrangements will be available shortly.

Release Date: August 10, 2010
For immediate release

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the pace
of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months. Household spending is

increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth,

lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising;

however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and employers remain

reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts remain at a depressed level. Bank lending has continued

to contract. Nonetheless, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource

utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be

more modest in the near term than had been anticipated.
Measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters and, with substantial
resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable,

inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.
The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and
continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization,

subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low

levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.
To help support the economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee will keep
constant the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities at their current level by reinvesting principal

payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury
securities.1 The Committee will continue to roll over the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury
securities as they mature.
The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will
employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C.
Dudley, Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Donald L. Kohn; Sandra Pianalto; Eric

S. Rosengren; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Kevin M. Warsh.
Voting against the policy was Thomas M. Hoenig, who judges that the economy is recovering
modestly, as projected. Accordingly, he believed that continuing to express the expectation of

exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted

and limits the Committee's ability to adjust policy when needed. In addition, given economic and

financial conditions, Mr. Hoenig did not believe that keeping constant the size of the Federal

Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current level was required to support a return

to the Committee's policy objectives.

technical note

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the
pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months. Household spending is

increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth,

lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising,

though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in nonresidential structures continues

to be weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts are at a depressed level.

Bank lending has continued to contract, but at a reduced rate in recent months. The Committee

anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability,

although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be modest in the near term.
Measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below those the Committee
judges most consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment

and price stability. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-

term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time before rising

to levels the Committee considers consistent with its mandate.
The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and
continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization,

subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low

levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee also will maintain its

existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.
The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is
prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to

return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C.
Dudley, Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S. Rosengren;

Daniel K. Tarullo; and Kevin M. Warsh.
Voting against the policy was Thomas M. Hoenig, who judged that the economy continues to
recover at a moderate pace. Accordingly, he believed that continuing to express the expectation of

exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted

and will lead to future imbalances that undermine stable long-run growth. In addition, given

economic and financial conditions, Mr. Hoenig did not believe that continuing to reinvest principal

payments from its securities holdings was required to support the Committee™s policy objectives.

lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising,

though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in nonresidential structures continues

depressed. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but measures of underlying

inflation have trended lower in recent quarters.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation

are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer

run, with its dual mandate. Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of

resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been

disappointingly slow.
To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at
levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to expand its holdings of

securities. The Committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from

its securities holdings. In addition, the Committee intends to purchase a further $600 billion of

longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of about $75

billion per month. The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the

overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the

program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and

Voting against the policy was Thomas M. Hoenig. Mr. Hoenig believed the risks of additional
securities purchases outweighed the benefits. Mr. Hoenig also was concerned that this continued

high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future financial imbalances and, over
time, would cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations that could destabilize the
economy.Statement from Federal Reserve Bank of New York

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December confirms that the
economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring about a

significant improvement in labor market conditions. Growth in household spending picked up late

last year, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing

wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, while investment

in nonresidential structures is still weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. The

housing sector continues to be depressed. Although commodity prices have risen, longer-term

inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been

trending downward.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that the
economic recovery is on a firmer footing, and overall conditions in the labor market appear to be

improving gradually. Household spending and business investment in equipment and software

continue to expand. However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing

sector continues to be depressed. Commodity prices have risen significantly since the summer, and

concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a sharp run-up in oil prices in

recent weeks. Nonetheless, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures

of underlying inflation have been subdued.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying

inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be

consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. The recent increases in the prices of energy

and other commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation. The Committee expects

these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and

inflation expectations. The Committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of

resource utilization in a context of price stability.

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in 
April indicates that the
economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the
Committee had expected.
  Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated.
 The slower pace of the recovery reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including

the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending

as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan.
  Household spending
and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand.
  However, investment in
nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. 
 Inflation
has picked up in recent months, 
mainly reflecting 
higher prices for 
some commodities and

imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions.
  However, l
onger-term inflation
expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability.
  The unemployment rate remains elevated
; however, the Committee expects the pace
of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual

decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.
  Inflationhas moved up recently, but the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside to levels at or

below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other

commodity price increases dissipate. 
 However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention

to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
 To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels

consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal

funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.
  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions--
including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium

run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended

period.  The Committee will complete its purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury
securities by the end of this month and will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal

payments from its securities holdings.
  The Committee will regularly review the size and

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that
economic growth so far this year has been considerably slower than the Committee had expected.
 Indicators suggest a deterioration in overall labor market conditions in recent months, and the

unemployment rate has moved up.
  Household spending has flattened out, investment in

nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. 
 However,
business investment in equipment and software continues to expand.
  Temporary factors, including
the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending

as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan, appear to account for

only some of the recent weakness in economic activity.
  Inflation picked up earlier in the year,

mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the supply

chain disruptions. 
 More recently, inflation has moderated as prices of energy and some

commodities have declined from their earlier peaks. 
 Longer-term inflation expectations have

remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. 
 The Committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming

quarters than it did at the time of the previous meeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate

will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual

mandate.  Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook have increased. The Committee also
anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent

with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price

increases dissipate further.
  However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the
evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels
consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal

funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. 
 The Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions--

including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium

run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-

2013.  The Committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from

its securities holdings. 
 The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its

securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.
The Committee discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic
recovery in a context of price stability.
  It will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of
incoming information and is prepared to employ these tools as appropriate.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C.
Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K.

Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen.
Voting against the action were: Richard W. Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, and Charles I. Plosser,

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that
economic growth remains slow. Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor

market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has been

increasing at only a modest pace in recent months despite some recovery in sales of motor vehicles

as supply-chain disruptions eased. Investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the

housing sector remains depressed. However, business investment in equipment and software

continues to expand. Inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of

energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations

To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels
consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to extend the average maturity of

its holdings of securities. The Committee intends to purchase, by the end of June 2012, $400

billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years and to sell an equal

amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less. This program should put

downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more

accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities

holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.
To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest principal
payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency

mortgage-backed securities. In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy of rolling

over maturing Treasury securities at auction.
The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that the
economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth. While

indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment

rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed

investment has slowed, and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has been subdued in

recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and

consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that

the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets

continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also

anticipates that over coming quarters, inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with

the Committee's dual mandate.
To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels
consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative

stance for monetary policy.
  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for

the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--

including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium

run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late

2014.The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings
of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of

reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed

securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at

auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings

and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in

a context of price stability.

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that
economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. Growth in

employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has

continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed. The

housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level.

Inflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently.

Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. The Committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic

growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.

Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the

economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely

would run at or below its 2 percent objective.
To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate
most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase policy

accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40

billion per month. The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to

extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining

its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency

mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. These actions, which together

will increase the Committee™s holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month

through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support

mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial
developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially,

the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake

additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement

is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its

asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and

costs of such purchases.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee
expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a

considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee also

decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently

anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least

through mid-2015.

agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury

securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of

reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed

securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at

auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest

rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more

accommodative.The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial
developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and

agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the

outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The

Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate

policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the

size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate

account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward

its economic objectives.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee
expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a

considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In

particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4

percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be

appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation
between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the
Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well
anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy,

the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market

conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial

developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take

a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of

2 percent.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C.
Dudley, Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell;

Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen.

Voting against the action was Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level

of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and,

over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations.

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that
economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown

further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.

Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has

strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory

influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term

inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic

growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward

levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside

risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The

Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2

percent objective.

shown further improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.

Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been

growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward

levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside

risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last

fall, but the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow

the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market. The Committee recognizes that

inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it

anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the Committee sees the improvement

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that
economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown further

improvement; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated. Household spending and

business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in

recent months. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint may

be diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-

term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic

growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward

levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the

outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced. The

Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to

economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that

inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset
purchase program, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market

conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.

In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the

outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its

asset purchases. Beginning in January, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-

backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add

to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45

billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal

payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency

mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The

Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain

downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make

broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger

economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with

the Committee's dual mandate.
The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-

backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor

market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly

supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and

inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of

asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a
preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the
Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely
efficacy and costs of such purchases.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee
today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain

appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic

recovery strengthens. The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally

low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as

the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is

projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run

goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long

to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider

other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation

pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee now

anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain

the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate

declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the

Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy

accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum

For immediate release

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that
growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather

conditions. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The

unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment

continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy is

restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been

running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have

remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic

activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve

gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The

Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced.

The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks

to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that

inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy
to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress

toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions

since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further

measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in April, the Committee will add

to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than

$30 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of

$30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing

policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-

backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury

securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term

securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage

markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should

promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate

most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-

market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly

supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and

inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of

asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a
preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the
Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely
efficacy and costs of such purchases.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee
today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains

appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the

federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its

objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account

a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation

pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee

continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to

maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset

For immediate release

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth
in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part

because of adverse weather conditions. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed

further improvement. The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. Household spending

appears to be rising more quickly. Business fixed investment edged down, while the recovery in the

housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of

restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective,

but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and
price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic

activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve

gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The

Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced.

The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks

to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that

inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy
to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress

toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions

since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further

measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in May, the Committee will add

to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than

$25 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of

$25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing

policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-

backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury

securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term

securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage

markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should

promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate

most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-

backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor

market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly

supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and

inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of

asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a
preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the
Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely
efficacy and costs of such purchases.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee
today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains

appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the

federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its

objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account

a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation

pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee

continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to

maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset

purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2

percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well

anchored.When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced
approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds

risks to the outlook for economic activity and the 
labor market as nearly balanced. Inflation is 
anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium
 term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines 
and other factors dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate 
remains appropriate. In determining how long to ma
intain this target range, the Committee will 
assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives 
of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
 inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments. 
Consistent with its previous statement, the 
Committee judges that an increase in the target 
range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April FOMC meeting. The Commi
ttee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. This change in the forward guidance does not indicate that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range. 
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of
 reinvesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's 
holdings of longer-term securitie
s at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to rem
ove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December 
suggests that labor market conditions improved further 
even as economic growth slowed late last 
year.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates 
in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been 
soft and inventory investm
ent slowed.  A range of recent labor market indicators, including 
strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.  

Inflation has continued to run below the Committee™s 2 percent longer
-run objective, partly 
refle
cting declines in energy prices and in prices of non
-energy imports.  Market
-based measures 
of inflation compensation declined further; survey
-based measures of longer

expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
 Consistent

employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustment
s in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor 
market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near 
term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2
 percent over the 
medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy an
d import prices dissipate and the 
labor market strengthens further.  The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and 
financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation

for
 the balance of risks to the 
outlook.
 Given the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range

  Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The 
Federal

stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in 
its statement on January 27
, 2016:   The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open 
Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:
  ﬁEffective 
January 28, 2016
, the Federal Open Market Commi
ttee directs the 
Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal 
funds rate in a target range of 1/4 to 1/2
 percent, including overnight reverse 
repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar 
trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, in amounts limited only 
by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market 
Account that are available
 for such operations and by a per
-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day.
 The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency 
debt and agency mortga
ge-backed securities in agency mortgage
-backed 
securities. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and 
coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve™s agency mortgage

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests 
that economic activity has been expanding 
at a moderate pace despite the global economic and 
financial developments of recent months.  Household spendin
g has been increasing at a moderate
 rate, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net 
exports have bee
n soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to 
additional strengthening of the labor market.  Inflation picked up in recent months; however, it 
continued to run below the Committee™s 2 percent longer
-run objective, partly refl
ecting declines 
in energy prices and in prices of non
-energy imports.  Market
-based measures of inflation 
compensation remain low; survey
-based measures of longer
-term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance, in recent months.
 Consistent with
 its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments 

in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor 
marke
t indicators will continue to strengthen.  However, global economic and financial 
developments continue to pose risks.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part 

because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent ove
r th
e medium term as the 
transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market 

strengthens further.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
 Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to main
tain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 
1/4
 to 
1/2 
percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby 
supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2
 percent inflation.
 In determining the timing a
nd size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its 
 (more)
    -2- objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
 This assessment will take into 
account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international 
developments.  In light of the cur
rent shortfall of inflation from 2
 percent, the Committee will 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects 
that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the
 federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are 

expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming dat
a. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage

nd it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates 
that labor market conditions have improved 
further even as growth in economic activity appears 

to have slowed.  Growth in household spending has moderated, although households™ real 
income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high.  Since the beginning of the 
year, the housing s
ector has improved further but business fixed investment and net exports have 
been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional 
strengthening of the labor market.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee™
s 2 percent longer
-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling 
prices of non
-energy imports.  Market
-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; 
survey
-based measures of longer
-term inflation expectations are lit
tle changed, on balance, in 
recent months
. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments 
in the stance of monetary policy, econom
ic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor 
market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near 

term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium 
term a
s the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor 
market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and 

global economic and financial developments
. Against this backdrop, the
 Committee decided to maintain the target range
 for the federal 
funds rate at 1/4
 to 
1/2
 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby 
supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation
. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its 
 (more)
   -2- objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into 
account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fina
ncial and international 
developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will 

carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects 
that economic conditions will evolve i
n a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are 

expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data
. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage
-backed securities in agency mortgage
-backed 
securities and 
of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by

T       December 14, 2016
  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been 
expanding at a moderate pace since mid
-year.  Job gains have been solid in recent m
onths and 
the unemployment rate has declined.  Household spending has been rising moderately but 
business fixed investment has remained soft.  Inflation has increased 
since earlier this year b
ut is 
still below the Committee™
s 2 percent longer
-run objective
, partly reflecting earlier declines in 
energy prices and in prices of non
-energy imports.  Market
-based measures of inflation 
compensation have moved up
 considerably but still are low; most survey
-based measures of 
longer
-term inflation expectations are l
ittle changed, on balance, in recent months. 
 Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the 
stance of monetary policy, economic acti
vity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions will strengthen somewhat further.  Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the 

medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and 
the labo
r market strengthens further.  Near
-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly 
balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic 

and financial developments.
 In view of realized and expected labor market c
onditions and inflation, the Committee 
decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to
 1/2
 to 
3/4
 percent.  
The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some
 further 
strengthening in labor 
market conditions and a 
return to 2 percent inflation.
 In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and
 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into

T       December 14
, 2016 - 2 Œ  account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readings on financial and international 
developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will 
carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects 
that
 economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are 

expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual pa
th of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
 The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage

securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so 
until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by

  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen 
and
 that
 economic activity 
has 
been rising at a 
moderate
 rate
.  Job gains have 
been
 strong in recent months, and the 
unemployment rate has stayed low.  Recent data suggest that growth rates of household 
spending and business fixed investment have moderated fr
om their strong fourth
-quarter 
readings.  On a 12
-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than 
food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent.   Market
-based measures of 
inflation compensation have increased in recent month
s but remain low; survey
-based 
measures of longer
-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
 Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The economic outlook has 
strengthened in recent 
months.  The Committee expect
s that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term 
and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on
 a 12
-month basis is 
expected to move up in coming months and 
to stabilize around the Committee™s 2 percent 
objective 
over the medium term
.  Near
-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly 
balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developm
ents closely.
 In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the 
Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1
-1/2 to 1
-3/4 
percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby 
supporting 
strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
 In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic condi
tions
 relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This

 - 2 - assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully 
monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation 
goal.  The Committe
e expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will 
warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely 
to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
Howev
er, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outloo
k as 
informed by incoming data.
