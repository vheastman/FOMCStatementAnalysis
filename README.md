# W266 Final Project

This repo contains the code and data for my final project for w266: Natural Language Processing

The bulk of the code used in the analysis can be found in `mmodels_final.ipynb`. Some text and data processesing was done in `process_data.ipynb` and the text data was explored in `EDA.ipynb`. Several failed attempts at analyzing these statements were conducted in `models_failed.ipynb`, but I admit I did not do much to clean or comment this file, so please disregard. 

Thanks for a great class!
